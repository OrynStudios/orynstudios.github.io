      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Why not just DIY it or use a workaround?</strong> Actually we LOVE a go-getter. Seriously, if you're exploring DIY options, we fully support that. In fact, we’re working on future offerings for the do-it-yourself crowd. But here's the truth: <strong>you don’t have to do it all alone.</strong> When you’re already juggling a hundred responsibilities, it helps to have someone in your corner offering clarity, ease, and real solutions. No more piecing together apps or wasting hours on things that could be handled in minutes. Let us simplify the process so you can focus on what you do best.</li>
        <li><strong>Do I need to be hands-on or available all the time?</strong> Nope. We handle everything. Just send over your brand assets (like your logo, fonts, and colors) if you’re opting for a branded experience. We’ll check in occasionally to make sure everything’s aligned, but otherwise, you can stay focused on your business while we handle the rest.</li>
        <li><strong>What’s the turnaround time?</strong> 1–12 weeks, depending on complexity and current volume.</li>
        <li><strong>How do I update the app?</strong> Don't worry, we won't leave you to figure it out on your own! We offer monthly support or simple hand-off options if you feel confident in your technical prowess.</li>
	<li><strong>What payment methods do you accept? What if I don't have all of the money up front?</strong> We accept major credit cards and other secure virtual payment options. If you’re not ready to pay in full, no worries. Flexible payment options are available! We understand every business is at a different stage, and we’re here to support you where you are.</li>
