      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Why would I collaborate with you when I could do it myself or find workarounds?</strong> Actually we LOVE a go-getter and fully support your decision if you would prefer to try your hand at learning some new skills. We are currently working on offerings for the DIY professional, stay tuned. However, the reality is that you don't have to! When you've already got a ton of responsibilities we aim to help make things easier on you, not give you homework or another project to figure out. We're offering solutions. Clarity. Ease. No more frankensteining tools to make your business work or spending hours on tasks that could be done in minutes if you had the right support. Let us work our magic. ;)</li>
        <li><strong>Do I need to be available constantly or do any of the work myself?</strong> Nope. We handle everything. You provide your brand assets such as logo, fonts, color palette, etc (if you opt for branded content.) We may check in occasionally to be sure you are satisfied with the direction of the project and any details.</li>
        <li><strong>What’s the turnaround time?</strong> 1–12 weeks, depending on complexity and current volume.</li>
        <li><strong>How do I update the app?</strong> Don't worry, we won't leave you to figure it out on your own! We offer monthly support or simple hand-off options if you feel confident in your technical prowess.</li>
	<li><strong>What payment methods do you accept? What if I don't have all of the money up front?</strong> We accept several virtual payment methods such as major credit cards. We also have the option for payment plans. We understand the needs and various stages of businesses. If you have any concerns let's chat!</li>
